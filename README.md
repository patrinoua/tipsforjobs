# Tips for Jobs!

### 0. Know What you are looking for
Write a paragraph where you describe your Dream Job. Then also make a list of points that are important to you. On every Interview write down the facts of these points you learned from the Interview, rate them (I use a 1-5 stars system, where 1 is very bad and 5 is excellent) and in the end come up with a general rating.


Example bullets could be

* PRODUCT
* TECH STACK 
* LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES
* LOCATION (& distance)
* SALARY
* TEAM SIZE

**Bonus Points for**

* FLEXIBILITY: (80-90% / home office)
* FUN FACTOR
* OFFICE
* WELCOMING

**GENERAL FEELING** 

Interviewing and solving coding tests can be a lengthy procedure, so only apply for positions that you would actually like to have and you will not end up rejecting later.

### 1. Pump up your Online Presence
#### Kick-ass CV
Take a look on canva (https://www.canva.com/templates/resumes/) where they have lots of free modern CV templates and see if you find something you like there. 
  On your CV do not forget to include useful links to github, linkedin etc.
#### LinkedIn
Fill your LinkedIn with relevant information about positions/projects you had in the past.
#### Github
If you are an aspiring coder show people your projects and how you write code on Github or a similar platform.
#### Portfolio
If your job is online/creative it's probably a good idea to have a portfolio.
This is your chance to show the world your favorite projects! Keep it narrow - remember nowdays in an overflood of information attention spans tend to be limitted. Choose your 3-5 most impressive projects and write maximum 100 words to describe them.  
You can try wix (http://wix.com/) for that or get in contact with me if you want something more custom.

#### All set, ready, go! Time for feedback!
Don't forget to link everything so people can find it: 

Have a link to your Portfolio on linkedIn, a link to your Github on your Portfolio (also a link to linkedIn and maybe CV), etc. Make sure the content you want to show is always a link away.

I'd be happy to take a look on your online presence and CV and suggest improvements. Get in touch!

Good luck! :)
