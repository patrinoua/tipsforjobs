# Tips for Jobs!
### 1. Pump up your Online Presence
#### Kick-ass CV
Take a look on canva (https://www.canva.com/templates/resumes/) where they have lots of free modern CV templates and see if you find something you like there. 
  On your CV do not forget to include useful links to github, linkedin etc.
#### LinkedIn
Fill your LinkedIn with relevant information about positions/projects you had in the past.
#### Github
If you are an aspiring coder show people your projects and how you write code on Github or a similar platform.
#### Portfolio
If your job is online/creative it's probably a good idea to have a portfolio. You can try wix (http://wix.com/) for that or get in contact with me.
#### All set, ready, go! Time for feedback!
Don't forget to link everything so people can find it: 

Have a link to your Portfolio on linkedIn, a link to your Github on your Portfolio (also a link to linkedIn and maybe CV), etc. Make sure the content you want to show is always a link away.

I'd be happy to take a look on your online presence and CV and suggest improvements. Get in touch!

Good luck! :)
