1. Take a look on canva (https://www.canva.com/templates/resumes/) where they have lots of free modern CV templates and see if you find something you like there. 
  On your CV do not forget to include useful links to github, linkedin etc.
2. Fill your LinkedIn with relevant information about positions you kept on the past
3. If your job is online/creative it's probably a good idea to have a portfolio. You can try wix (http://wix.com/) for that or get in contact with me
4. I'd be happy to take a look on your online presense and CV and suggest improvements. Get in touch!

Good luck! :)
