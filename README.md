## Pump up your Online Presence
### 1. Kick-ass CV
Take a look on canva (https://www.canva.com/templates/resumes/) where they have lots of free modern CV templates and see if you find something you like there. 
  On your CV do not forget to include useful links to github, linkedin etc.
### 2. LinkedIn
Fill your LinkedIn with relevant information about positions/project you had in the past

### 3. Portfolio
If your job is online/creative it's probably a good idea to have a portfolio. You can try wix (http://wix.com/) for that or get in contact with me.
### All set, ready, go! Time for feedback!
I'd be happy to take a look on your online presence and CV and suggest improvements. Get in touch!

Good luck! :)
