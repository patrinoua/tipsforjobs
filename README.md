# Tips for Jobs!

### 0. Know What you are looking for
Write a paragraph where you describe your Dream Job. Then also make a list of points that are important to you. On every Interview write down the facts of these points you learned from the Interview, rate them (I use a 1-5 stars system, where 1 is very bad and 5 is excellent) and in the end come up with a general rating.


Example bullets could be

* PRODUCT
* TECH STACK 
* LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES
* LOCATION (& distance from where you live)
* SALARY
* TEAM SIZE

**Bonus Points for**

* FLEXIBILITY: (80-90% / home office)
* FUN FACTOR
* OFFICE
* WELCOMING

**GENERAL FEELING** 

Interviewing and coding challenges can be a lengthy procedure, so only apply for positions that you would actually like to have and you will not end up rejecting later.

### 1. Pump up your Online Presence
#### Kick-ass CV
Take a look on canva (https://www.canva.com/templates/resumes/) where they have lots of free modern CV templates and see if you find something you like there. For a more serious format you can also check https://novoresume.com/
  On your CV do not forget to include useful links to github, linkedin etc.
#### LinkedIn
Fill your LinkedIn with relevant information about positions/projects you had in the past.
Optimise your linkedin [link](https://careers.workopolis.com/advice/optimize-linkedin-profile-job-hunt-will-thank/)
#### Github
If you are an aspiring coder show people your projects and how you write code on Github or a similar platform.
#### Portfolio
If your job is online/creative it's probably a good idea to have a portfolio.
This is your chance to show the world your favorite projects! Keep it narrow - remember nowdays in an overflood of information attention spans tend to be limitted. Choose your 3-5 most impressive projects and write maximum 100 words to describe them.  
You can build a custom one, try wix (http://wix.com/), or get in touch with me.

#### All set, ready, go! Time for feedback!
Don't forget to link everything so people can find it: 

Have a link to your Portfolio on linkedIn, a link to your Github on your Portfolio (also a link to linkedIn and maybe CV), etc. 
Make sure the content you want to show is always a link away.

I'd be happy to take a look on your online presence and CV and suggest improvements. Get in touch!

Good luck! :)
